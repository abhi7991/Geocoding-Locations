# Geocoding-Locations
This is my first and basic project of mine , I have used Googles's Geocoding API to retrieve a set of latitude and longitudes by running a simple python script. Just follow the given steps

Step1:Change the Working Directory

Step2:Change the file name and add the header-address

Step3:Run the file

Let me know If I can optimize it in any way

Cheers
